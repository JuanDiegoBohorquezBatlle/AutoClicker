# AutoClicker
This is a simple auto clicker, programmed in python 3.0, use the pynput libraries; I leave next his full documentation: https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/search.html?q= and you can download the library here: https://pypi.org/project/pynput/

The code is not optimized at all, and it does not have a graphical interface, it uses the terminal to communicate with the user.

# Important
If you want to use the sript you must download the pynput library apart.

You can stop the script pressing the “q” key or pause it pressing the space key.

This script allows you to choose the interval (measured in seconds or milliseconds) between clicks.

You can not introduce intervals smaller than 0.001 seconds or 1 milliseconds.

After using the script first time, a folder named AutoClicker and a file called conf.py will be created in the path C:/Users/Public/ which serves as a record of the last interval between clicks you used, this is done in case you don't want to rewrite the variables always you use the script, this file only have one line with the time constant.

Here There is two version, one in English and the other is in Spanish.
