This is a simple auto clicker, programmed in python 3.0, use the pynput libraries; I leave next his full documentation: https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/search.html?q= and how download the library: https://pypi.org/project/pynput/

The code is not optimized at all, and it does not have a graphical interface, it uses the terminal to communicate with the user.

# Important
If you want to use the sript you must download the pynput library apart.
You can stop the script pressing the “q” key.

This script allows you to choose the interval (measured in seconds) between clicks.

You can not introduce intervals smaller than 0.001 seconds.
